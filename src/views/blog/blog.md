# Ethereum Degen's Blog

It is my mission to build open-source resources for the web3+defi  community. these are all the blogs about my open-source projects.  Feel free to fork and use my code to help you build for Ethereum and the next gen internet. 

You will find templates for sign-in-with-ethereum using react, solidity token templates, and scripts for scraping chain events for building dapp frontends.
